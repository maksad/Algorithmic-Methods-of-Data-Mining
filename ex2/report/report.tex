        Before analyzing the complexity and responding to the question it could be nice to see an algorithm that finds the $max$ number in an array. Such algorithm can be easily written in python, that gives us a clear picture of how the computation is done:
        \begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg,linenos,fontsize=\small,autogobble]{python}
          def get_max(X):
            max_num = -1
            for i in X:
                if max_num < i:
                    max_num = i
            return max_num
        \end{minted}

        The best case for finding the $max$ element is when the first element is bigger than all of the other elements of $X$, which has complexity of $O(1)$. And the worst case is when the last element is the largest and all the consecutive numbers proceed from small to large. This case has a complexity of $O(n)$. The tricky part is the average case, where we have to compute the complexity for \textit{the number of times that max is assigned to an element}. To do that, we need to do a probabilistic analysis for the average case of assigning $max$ to $X_i$ that will be made on execution.

        Assuming that $X[1,2,3...m]$ is drawn independently and uniformly at random from the interval $(0,1)$, the expected probability will be:
        \begin{align*}
          E[x] = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} Pr(X_i)
        \end{align*}

        Where $Pr(X_i)$ is the probability of the $i_{th}$ element being the $max$ element in $X[1,2,3...m]$.
